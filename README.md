E-Motion
========

E-Motion is a Java Image Processing Library built over [Etyllica](https://github.com/yuripourre/etyllica/).

Comparing to other computer vision libraries it is:

- easier to use
- easier to configure
- easier to debug
- probably slower

### Main Goal:
The main goal is port widely known algorithms to Java and create a tool to help programmers to work with image processing/computer vision. If you are looking for an ultrafast library, try [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) instead.
