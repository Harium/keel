Etyllic Motion
==============

Etyllic Motion is a Java Image Processing Library built over [Etyllica](https://github.com/yuripourre/etyllica/). 

Comparing to other computer vision libraries it is:

- higher-level
- easier to use 
- probably slower

#### Main Goal
The main goal is port widely known algorithms to Java and create a set of tools to help programmers to work with image processing/computer vision. If you are looking for a ultrafast library, try [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) instead.


#### Features:

##### Seach Algorithms: 
- by Color
- by Skin Color
- Flood Fill
- Corners

##### Modifier Algorithms:
- [Quick Hull](https://github.com/yuripourre/etyllic-motion/wiki/Quick%20Hull)
- Jarvis March
- Posit
- [Coplanar Posit](https://github.com/yuripourre/etyllic-motion/wiki/Coplanar-Posit)

##### Image Capture: 

It uses v4l4j to capture webcam stream. More details: [Installing V4l4j](https://github.com/yuripourre/etyllic-motion/wiki/Installing-V4l4j)
